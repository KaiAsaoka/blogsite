Hi! Thank you for visiting my blog.

My name is Kai Asaoka, and I am a 4th year student studying Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia. I have a deep passion for the automotive industry, and I intend to use this blog to research and learn about cars and their functions. I also have interests in robotics and machine learning, and I hope to write about these interests as well. 

Please feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaiasaoka/), and visit my seperate personal website [here](https://kaiasaoka.github.io/).
